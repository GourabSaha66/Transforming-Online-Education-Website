            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Physical education, also known as Phys Ed., PE, gym, or gym class, and
                in some Commonwealth countries as physical training or PT,is a class that pupils are required to
                take at school. It is taken during primary and secondary education and encourages psychomotor learning
                in a play or movement exploration setting to promote health and physical fitness.
                
                In addition, physical literacy is a 21st-century term that first emerged in the sport literature before
                also being applied to physical education. The concept of physical literacy covers a variety of
                conditions for a student.Whether it is motivation, confidence, physical competence, knowledge and
                understanding for student. Teachers implement these different concepts into their lesson plans to teach
                and develop students accordingly and appropriately for their individual success and education.</p>

                <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of
                    knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching, training,
                    storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of
                    educators, however learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal
                    settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be
                    considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.</p>

                    <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education in India is primarily managed by state-run public education
                        system, which fall under the command of the government at three levels: federal, state and local. Under
                        various articles of the Indian Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education
                Act, 2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14.
                The approximate ratio of public schools to private schools in India is 7:5. Major policy initiatives in
                Indian education are numerous. Up until 1976, education policies and implementation were determined
                legally by each of India’s constitutional states. The 42nd amendment to the constitution in 1976 made
                education a ‘concurrent subject’. From this point on the central and state governments shared formal
                responsibility for funding and administration of education. In a country as large as India, now with 28
                states and eight union territories, this means that the potential for variations between states in the
                policies, plans, programs and initiatives for elementary education is vast. Periodically, national
                policy frameworks are created to guide states in their creation of state-level programs and policies.
                State governments and local government bodies manage the majority of primary and upper primary schools
                and the number of government-managed elementary schools is growing. Simultaneously the number and
                proportion managed by private bodies is growing. In 2005-6 83.13% of schools offering elementary
                education (Grades 1-8) were managed by government and 16.86% of schools were under private management
                (excluding children in unrecognised schools, schools established under the Education Guarantee Scheme
                and in alternative learning centers). Of those schools managed privately, one third are ‘aided’ and two
                thirds are ‘unaided’. Enrolment in Grades 1-8 is shared between government and privately managed schools
                in the ratio. However in rural areas this ratio is higher (80:20) and in urban areas much lower
